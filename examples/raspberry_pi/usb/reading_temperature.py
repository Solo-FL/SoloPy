# EXAMPLE of how read the SOLO board temperature,
# every second we print the value of the temperature

import SoloPy as solo

import time

# instanciate a SOLO object:
# check with SOLO motion terminal that you are able to connect to your device and make sure the port name in the code is the correct one 
mySolo = solo.SoloMotorControllerUart("/dev/ttyACM0", 0, solo.UartBaudRate.RATE_937500)

# loop actions
while True:
    # reading
    temperature, error = mySolo.get_board_temperature()

    # print
    print("Read from SOLO: " + str(temperature))
    print("Error: " + str(error))

    time.sleep(1)
